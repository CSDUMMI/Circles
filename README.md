# Circles
The Circles Network shall be a social, democratic, user controlled and based on the users will network.

Todays networks through which the majority of the people connected
to the world wide web interact with each other, are controlled by a single, profit oriented company,
focused on making profit and thus keeping control of their users. 

They have control about your content, your experience of the network 
and decide by hidden rules, what content to show to you.
Because they are a profit oriented company, these rules and your experience
of the network aims at making profit for the company.
And not on informing you about your interests or
creating a space to life and communicate in, if
other content brings them more attention, profits and reach.

We have seen that this control can't be in the interest of the public,
because it can manipulate people and even be used to manipulate the democratic
process of a sovereign nation.
Thus I think we should take away the control of the network from such a profit oriented company
and control it ourselves.
We need to identifiy the different kinds of decisions these companies
make in their network, to decide how to make these decisions later
