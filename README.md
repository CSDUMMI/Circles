# Circles
The Circles Network shall be a social, democratic, user controlled and based on the users will network.

Todays networks through which the majority of the people connected
to the world wide web interact with each other, are controlled by a single, commercial company,
focused on making profit and thus keeping control about their users. 

They have control about your content, your experience of the network 
and decide by hidden rules, what content to show to you.
Because they are a profit oriented company, these rules and your experience
of the network focuses on making profit for the company.
And not on informing you about your interests
