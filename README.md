# Circles
The Circles Network shall be a social, democratic, user controlled network.

## Why should we let the users control a network?
Todays networks are for me, what would be called a dictatorship,
if it were a nation state.
And it would be exploiting its citizens, which are the users.
Circles shall thus be democratic, meaning that instead of the developers
or a companies interest, users decide upon what they want to see, which features
should be developed and how they want to keep the network running.

## What decisions do networks currently make on their own?
Before explaining how I want to develop a democratic network, we have to look
at what decisions the companies running a network currently make:
1. Budget decisions - Investments
2. Income - Revenue
3. Algorithmns - Optimizing for Profit / Attention
4. Rights of the User - Terms of Use
I put the same thing into to different forms, so you might better understand what
I mean by it.
This is not a complete lists and can be appended 
by points.
