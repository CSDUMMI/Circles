# Circles
The Circles Network shall be a social, democratic, user controlled network.

## Why should we let the users control a network?
Todays networks are for me, what would be called a dictatorship,
if it were a nation state.
And it would be exploiting its citizens, which are the users.
Circles shall thus be democratic, meaning that instead of the developers
or a companies interest, users decide upon what they want to see, which features
should be developed and how they want to keep the network running.

## What decisions do networks currently make on their own?
Before explaining how I want to develop a democratic network, we have to look
at what decisions the companies running a network currently make:
1. Budget decisions - Investments - what is worth to put money into?
2. Income - Revenue - Where do we get money from?
3. Algorithmns - Optimizing for Profit / Attention - How do we display our network?
4. Rights of the User - Terms of Use - What can each User do, what are a users rights?

I put the same thing into to different forms, so you might better understand what
I mean by it.
This is not a complete lists and can be appended.
 
## So how do you want to make a network democratic?
Repeated elections are the base of democracy.
But I don't want every user to vote on every issue,
because not everybody can inform themselves on every issue,
if they don't want to do something else still.
Instead the user will elect a representation and this will vote on each
issue. Only a few important decision should be made by popular vote.

## The representation of the users
The representation should be a group of elected users,
which can decide upon issues by 2/3 Majority.
They can't make decisions about everything.
They shall not be able to change the electoral
rules.

## The Election of the representation
I think that there will be a group of users elected
by a general election, which will be repeated after a defined
period. The users will have one vote to elect one candidate and
the most popular ones go to the representation.
How many will be calculated by the number of users
and every X users will get a new candidate.
X should increase, proportionally to the number of users.

## What should be decided by the representation and what by popular vote?
This Question is very important and I want to draw a line, that should be easy to understand:
**The representation shouldn't change how they are elected**, so everything regarding
elections must be changed by popular vote.

## How do I plan to develop the Circles Network?
I will try to develop the alpha version on my own and hopefully with some help from other developers.
Later every patch, change, etc. has to be confirmed by the representation or the popular vote, meaning that 2/3 accept
the proposal. Then the proposal, if it is a change to the code, is implemented in the running enviornment.
If the proposal concerns the elections, these have to be accepted by popular vote, not the representation.
I don't talk about implementation details, because I want to be free to create the best network alpha possible,
before, after alpha the representation is first elected and takes up its job.
